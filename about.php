			My name is Shamus and I'm a full-time Information Technology Student. 
			I wanted to practice my skills by making a webpage for my photography hobby! 
			As I learn more about Web Development this page will evolve. 
			I am not a professional photographer I just enjoy taking photos of things that interest me. 
			I use a Minolta XG-M 35mm film camera with 400 ISO film.
