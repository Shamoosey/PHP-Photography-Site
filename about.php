			Hi, my name is Shamus and I'm a full-time Information Technology Student. 
			I wanted to practice my skills by making a webpage for my photography hobby! 
			As I learn more about Web Development this page will evolve. 
			I am not a professional photographer I just enjoy taking photos of things that interest me. 
			I use a Minolta XG-M 35mm film camera with 400 ISO film.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since I am a amature photographer I want to try and improve my skills and I figured the best way to do that would be to offer shoots. 
			This would be a time where me and you would go out and take photos. If you are intrested in booking a shoot please fill out <a style="text-decoration: none; font-style: italic;" href="bookAptForm.html">this</a>
			form with your personal information and contact information so I know how to reach you and I will book a time that works for both of us!
