				My name is Shamus and I'm a full-time Information Technology Student. 
				I wanted to practice my skills by making a webpage for my photography hobby! 
				As I learn more about Web Development this page will evolve.
				<br/> 
				I am not a professional photographer I just enjoy taking photos of things that interest me. 
				I use a Minolta XG-M 35mm film camera with 400 ISO film.

				Please remember that this website is a work in progress and is being changed over time.
